# Unity2D-Cam-Follow-with-Delay
A simple script for Unity 2D that makes your camera follow the player.

Make sure that your camera has a Rigidbody 2D component on it.
Put your player object into the target slot.
Put your Rigidbody 2D into the camRigidbody slot.

If you want to use a delay and/or use smooth movement when the camera moves to the player check the appropriate booleans.
If none of them are checked it will default to no smooth movement and no delay.

I know that this script can definitely be improved and all the else if statements hurt me too so feel free to modify it.
